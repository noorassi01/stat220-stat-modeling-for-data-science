# Description of Projects 
  ## Project 1:
  The objective is to analyze how data scientist salaries vary in relation to three key factors: experience, company size, and job title. To achieve this, you will create plots and tables that facilitate a clear understanding of these relationships.
  ## Project 2:
  In this lab, I developed a tool that helps users calculate the probabilities of specific events occurring during gameplay, enhancing their strategic planning. For instance, users may wish to calculate the probability of the sum of two six-sided dice being 10 or more.
  ## Project 3:
  In this project, we were given a scenario and a role. As budding statisticians and data scientists, my task was to assist the association in this endeavor. I was required to analyze the data to find the maximum likelihood estimates of each variable under the assumption of a normal distribution.
  ## Project 4:
  In this project, we were given a scenario and a role. A local bike-sharing company named CycleHub aims to better understand the factors that influence the demand for their bikes. Accurate estimation and prediction can help them allocate resources more efficiently, thereby optimizing operations and maximizing customer satisfaction. As a student of statistics and data science, I was tasked to help CycleHub analyze this data using simple and multiple regression as well as regression trees. My findings are aimed to aid in decision-making processes and strategic planning.
  ## Project 5-6:
  In this lab exercise, I delved into a dataset provided by the U.S. Health Department that represents different hospitals across four major regions: northeast, north-central, south, and west. The primary objective is to determine the regional effect on the risk of infection in hospitals.
  I analyzed the data using regression analysis and Bayesian analysis.
  ## Project 7:
  The description of the project: 

  "You are a part of a multidisciplinary team of scientists, statisticians, and oceanographers stationed at an international marine research facility. Your team has been tasked with understanding the mechanisms behind the El Ni˜ no phenomenon. El Ni˜ no is a warming of the ocean waters that affects weather patterns as well as agriculture in regions that in turn affect the rest of the world. Accurate prediction of El Ni˜ no is an area of much interest. El Ni˜ no happens on average once every 5 years. However, some anomalies have been observed, such as 2016 and 2017, where back to back El Ni˜no’s were observed. You can learn more about it here. Your team has managed to collect a trove of valuable data during various expeditions, risking turbulent seas and unpredictable weather conditions. But data, as raw as the ocean’s tides, needs to be refined to extract the wisdom within. As a data-savvy member of this team, you’re equipped with the tools of statistics and data science to dig deeper. Our goal in this lab is to build the best model we can based on the data."

  I analyzed the data using regression analysis and regression tree analysis.
  ## Project 8:
  The description of the project:

  "You are part of a research team focusing on the biology and ecology of possums. The team has collected a dataset that includes multiple physical measurements from various possums. The objective is to provide a tool to predict the age of these creatures. Do we need to measure the possum in a variety of ways, or perhaps is there just one or two characteristics that can be enough to estimate age. Understanding the aging patterns could provide valuable insights into their lifecycle and how they interact with their environment. Your role as a data scientist is to employ statistical techniques to build the best model possible. In this lab, you will exclusively explore the impact of log and polynomial transformations on predictive modeling."

  I analyzed the data using Log and Polynomial Transformations.
  ## Project 10:
  The description of the project:

  "You are now part of the Advanced Construction Analytics Division (ACAD) at Global Building Insights (GBI), a pioneering consultancy in the construction sector. ACAD is renowned for merging statistical rigor with practical utility in its analytical models. Our clients, primarily Construction Estimators, rely heavily on these models to predict project timelines accurately. However, they emphasize the need for these models to be interpretable, allowing for clear understanding and communication of results. In response to this need, your task is to develop a model that not only predicts the completion time of construction projects with high accuracy but also maintains a level of simplicity and interpretability. This lab focuses on striking the right balance between these two often competing aspects of model building."
  ## Project 11:
  The description of the project:

  "You are hired as data scientists by Mashable, an online news platform that generates buzz through shares of their posts. You are tasked with the responsibility of building a model that will be able to predict the number shares a news article will get based on characteristics of the article."
